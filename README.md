# Pfat
Pfat, (Protein Function Annotation Tool), a novel software that predicts the function of unknown proteins by using a motif-profile based analysis, where repeat motifs sequences are used for protein family classification and later excluded based on a subsequent phylogenetic analysis on sequence similarities within protein families.
